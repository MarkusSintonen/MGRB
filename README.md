# MGRB
Sparse Roaring Bitmap based on https://roaringbitmap.org/ but rewritten and simplified for use in `RaptorDB` with the added benefit of utilizing sparse data structures (i.e. not storing empty containers/blocks of bits).

## Notes
If forget to update this repo, the newest version is in https://github.com/mgholam/RaptorDB-Document
